/**
 * Servers are used to provide features to the client.
 *
 * Servers can make use of the {CredentialsProvider}, {Lsp}, {Workspace}, {Logging} and {Telemetry} features
 * to implement their functionality. Servers are notexpected to perform actions when their method
 * is called, but instead to set up listeners, event handlers, etc to handle.
 *
 * {CredentialsProvider}}, {Lsp}, and {Workspace} features may be initialized asynchronously, and can be empty until initialization
 * is completed and the client or user provides the necessary information. It's up to Server implementations to
 * either wait for the content to become available, or to gracefully handle cases where content is not yet available.
 *
 * The main use case for Servers is to listen to {Lsp} events and respond to these appropriately.
 *
 * @returns A function that will be called when the client exits, used to dispose of any held resources.
